        <p class="main">When a storm affects your area, the first thing you want to know is where to go and what to avoid. AfterSorm allows you to do this by showing you flooded routes, finding businesses that are open near you and giving you access to other important emergency relief information.</p>

        <p class="main">AfterSorm’s groundbreaking voice assistance feature, <i>Iris</i>, guides you through the app and effortlessly provides access to the information that matters most to you.</p>

            <p class="lead">Floods and weather emergencies are stressful and costly. A stalled car in a flooded road and damage to a non-elevated house can set residents of flood-prone areas back thousands of dollars. After speaking to residents and hearing their concerns, we knew we wanted to make something that would make their lives before, during, and after a flood easier.</p>

            <h4>Trying to Avoid a Flooded Route</h4>
            <p class="lead">One of the biggest concerns for residents when a floor occurs is getting back home when streets begin to get flooded. Due to bad drainage, many roads can get so flooded that many cars can’t make it out. AfterSorm makes avoiding these streets easy with voice command: you can ask it to find flooded areas or to take you home avoiding flooded streets.</p>

            <h4>Finding the Nearest Open Gas Station</h4>
            <p class="lead">During a flood, there are few apps that will tell you actual operating hours. This often means either searching the web and calling around or avoiding going out to shops altogether. Unfortunately, when there is a weather emergency, there are certain trips that cannot be avoided, such as getting gas. AfterSorm provides you with updated business hours and businesses near you that are still open.</p>

            <p class="lead">AfterSorm’s information crowdsourcing feature makes it quick and easy to report opening hours for everything from a store to a shelter as well as potential risks during a flood: powerlines that are down, flood debris, water contamination, etc). AfterSorm was made for reporting, which can be done via voice or with just a few typed commands.</p>
